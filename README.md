# steamcmd-batchdl
## quick-n-dirty js to generate a batch script for steamcmd to download an entire collection at once
### I'm assuming you have steamcmd installed
## instructions 
Run [this script](script.js) on any steam collection page that is <strong>for only one game</strong> <br>
Make the downloaded .sh executable and run it. <br>
<strong> That's it </strong>
### notes
This script may help gog users or blackbeard's buddies.
I made this for my linux mint machine, if it doesn't work for windows or another distro, that's your problem.
